In addition to eucalyptus leaves, rice is also a staple for me. Today I gained a
new understanding about a feature on my rice cooker that also shed some light on
how my own brain thinks and how new technology can be non-intuitive for existing
users.

The feature in question is the timer. While this feature is not new (I've used
it many times before), I learned today that I've been using it incorrectly.

Here's how I (incorrectly) operated the timer: I set a time, press start, and
expect the rice to start cooking at the set time. I know how long the rice
cooker roughly needs to cook the amount of rice that I need, so this mode of
operation seemed intuitive to me.

What the timer feature actually does is that it *finishes* cooking the rice at
the time you specify. This makes a ton of sense because that is what the user
cares about and you wouldn't expect the user to know how long the cooking
takes, especially for different amounts of rice.

The more interesting question is why I was operating the rice cooker in the way
I did. My hypothesis is that growing up my family had a rice cooker without a
timer, so I perceived all rice cookers as needing an explicit start signal. In
this sense, I'm part of the "old generation" of rice cooker users, unaccustomed
to the new features of modern rice cookers.

I think this lesson generalizes to technology in general - when improving an
existing product, legacy users can be confused by some of the new features, even
if those features have been designed with usability in mind.
