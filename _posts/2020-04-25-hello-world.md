I have wanted to start a blog for a long time now and the COVID-19
shelter-in-place order gave me plenty of time to finally get started.

I intend to use this blog for 2 purposes:
1.  To share practical tips and tricks that I've picked up as a software
    engineer. These are things like "how to debug X on AWS", "how to do Y with
    [bazel](https://bazel.build/)", or "how to write Z in golang". My hope is
    that my posts will save time for other engineers who encounter the same
    issues.
1.  To occasionally publish my thoughts on current events and the world around
    me.

I chose the name of this blog to reflect these 2 goals, as the word "thoughtful"
can mean considerate/kind as well as pensive/reflective. Of course, the
availability of the domain name also factored into the naming decision.

P.S. By coincidence, I started this blog on [Anzac
day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzac_Day) 2020 - a good fit for a
koala-themed blog.
