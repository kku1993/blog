[秀才遇到兵, 有理說不清](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%A7%80%E6%89%8D%E9%81%87%E5%88%B0%E5%85%B5%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E6%9C%89%E7%90%86%E8%AA%AA%E4%B8%8D%E6%B8%85)
is a Chinese idiom that summarizes one of my greatest fears. Translated
literally, it means "a scholar meets a foot soldier - cannot reason with the
soldier." The implication is that it's impossible to communicate with an
ignorant person, since soldiers in ancient China were usually not well-educated.
Recently, I learned about an equivalent phrase in English, stated eloquently by
Martin Luther King Jr. as "Nothing in all the world is more dangerous than
sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity."

We can find many examples of "soldiers" wreaking havoc throughout history.
For example, during the [Cultural
Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution), scores of
student Red Guards burned artifacts and murdered "anti-revolutionaries" as
unsuspecting pawns in a political power struggle. I have no doubt that they
truly believed in their mission and felt justified for their actions, hence
"sincere" in their ignorance and "conscientious" in carrying out their mission.

Even today, we see examples of climate change deniers and anti-vaxxers who act
out of misguided beliefs, putting their own lives and the communities around
them at risk. The worst part is that words and reasoning from the "scholar"
usually breed animosity between the two groups rather than changing minds.

This is why the "scholar meets soldier" scenario scares me - I would hate to be
a helpless "scholar" trying to reason to no avail, and I'm even more horrified
of unknowingly being a "soldier" on topics that I'm not well-versed on.

I think having an affordable, accessible, and high-quality public education
system is the long-term solution to creating a well-informed society and
reducing the number of "soldiers." In the meantime, I need to constantly remind
myself to stay updated on current issues and not be dismissive of other people's
views without deeper thoughts, or risking becoming a "soldier" myself.
